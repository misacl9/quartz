### The Plan (CR)
#### Hideout
**Toy Maker** deep dwarf hermit of the forge domain
- Russian voice (think the guardians)
- His helpers are deep gnomes
- He delivers toys to the good kids, what does he give bad?

**Client** Unknown, only communicated by letter, requests a clockwork toy made of a rare metal (valiar) impossible to bend by any known means.
- The metal is a stunning silver white, like the hairs of an ancient nine-tailed snow fox.

**Alwayswinter** snowy mountain region, for simplicity sake the location of workshop is known to them as a set of secret interconnected tunnels in the heart of the mountain range
