- Thanksgiving themed
- **Setting**: Chi-re (chicago shire). North side ran by "Bugs" Moran, south side ran by Fowl Capone. Building up to Saint Augustine's day massacre
	- Aside St. Augustine is now a hippo folk
- Who the party sides with determines future of the Chi-re
- **Context:** North side has been racketeering and launching attacks against South Sides casinos and brothels. Now the gangs are "agreeing" to a ceasefire with the coming of brewing for Saint Augustine.
	- Brewing is legal in this world
	- What is under prohibition is necromancy which the police suspect of both sides.
- **Motivation:** North side wants to eliminate Fowl Capone. South side wants to end their attacks any means necessary. Police want to apprehend practitioners of necromancy and how aggressive they do it depend on the blaziness of the gangs.
- **Player engagement** Cops need heroes to help them with corruption and lay law. Fowl Capone offers financial compensation and connections to evert law. "Bugs" Moran desires "justice" and taking back the Chi-re from the oppressors.
