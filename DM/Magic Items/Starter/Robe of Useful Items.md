Wondrous Item

Rarity (uncommon)

Covered in patches, use an action to remove a patch and transform into an object. Once all patches are removed the robe is no longer magical.

By default a robe has two of each patch:
- Dagger
- Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
- Steel mirror
- 10-foot pole
- Rope (50 ft)
- Sack
