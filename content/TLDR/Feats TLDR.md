All origin are good and some are really good (speedy)

General
- A lot of neat spell granters
- Crusher for bludgeoner
- Inspiring Leader for Wis or Cha
- Mage Slayer sadly not about slaying but ruining spells
- Crossbow expert makes hand crossbow OP
- Grappler perfect for monk
- Dual Wielder + Nick seems interesting
- Polearm Master makes spear and quarterstaff perfect and all reach weapons even better 
- Sentinel opportunity attacks go brrr
- Sharpshooter is ranged master race to melee console
- Speedy for squishy guys who don't want to get caught
- Spell Sniper means no one can escape your reach
- Telekinetic better than arcane trickster mage hand??
- Weapon Master requires knowing how to min max weapon mastery
- Skulker good for stealth builds
- Durable helps avoid dying if you can afford neglecting other areas

Fighting Style Feats only matter to Fighter, Paladin, and Ranger and provide a balanced boost to they way you want to fight

Epic boon feats are epic for a reason
