This page is basically just to rank weapons as either worthwhile or just get something else with same properties but more usable (i.e. a versatile weapon that achieves same **damage** and **effect** and **cost** or cheaper as two-handed weapon)

Bludgeoning > Piercing > Slashing

THESE RANKINGS RADICALLY CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR FEATS ARE
- Crossbow expert makes hand crossbow OP
- Crusher makes bludgeoning the cool guy
- Dual Wielder + Nick seems interesting
- Polearm Master makes spear and quarterstaff perfect and all reach weapons even better 
- Sharpshooter is ranged master race to melee console
- Great Weapon Fighting

**Unsure**
Whip (is unique as only finesse reach) -> use Pike for reach or Javelin or Sling for slow
Dart -> use Dagger instead for added melee
Sling -> use Javelin for slow
Greatclub -> use Warhammer for push

**Trash**
Morningstar -> use Spear or War Pick for sap
Flail  -> use Spear for sap or Warhammer for damage
Trident -> use Spear instead for thrown or Quarterstaff for topple
Club -> Light hammer for thrown, Javelin or Sling for slow
Pike -> use Lance for reach
Blowgun -> use Handaxe or Dart for vex
Longsword -> use War Pick for everything
Scimitar -> use Dagger for everything
Sickle -> use Dagger for everything instead

**Perfect**
Dagger: Simple weapon, Finesse, Light, Thrown, Nick
Lance: Reach, Topple with Reach makes it better than Push to avoid opportunity attacks, mount to wield in one hand
Shortbow: Simple, Ranged, Vex
Maul: 2d, Bludgeoning, Topple
Greatsword: 2d, Graze 

**Great**
Warhammer: Bludgeoning, Versatile, Push
Quarterstaff: Simple, Bludgeoning, Versatile
Spear: Simple, Thrown, Versatile, best Sap
Javelin: Simple, Thrown, Slow
Glaive: Reach, Graze is situationally better than Halberd's Cleave
War Pick: Piercing better than slashing, Versatile
Handaxe: Simple, Light, Thrown, Vex
Hand Crossbow: Ranged, Light
Rapier: Finesse, Vex
Longbow: Ranged, Slow

**Good**
Mace -> use Spear for sap
Halberd -> use Glaive for reach
Greataxe -> use Greatsword for 2d, use Halberd for cleave
Battleaxe -> use Lance for topple
Light Crossbow -> use Shortbow for no loading or Longbow for slow
Heavy Crossbow -> unique
